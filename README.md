Dotfiles
========

This is a collection of my dotfiles used on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.

The files are managed using [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

The dotfiles are related to

- BASH

- Git
- LaTeX
- R
- Ruby gems
- Vim
- ZSH
- rcrc
- tmux


## Vim

The `.vim` directory is symlinked on the top level (as specified in the `rcrc` file).


## ZSH

My ZSH plugins are managed by [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen).

My `zshrc` file is heavily inspired [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
